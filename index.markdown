### About Me

Hello!  
I’m Yoonmi Choi, a PhD student in the Biological Systems Engineering department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where I am part of Songlab.  
My research focuses on the intricate interactions between plants and microbes.  
I use computational modeling and experimental approaches to better understand and optimize these interactions for sustainable agriculture.  

<i> This website serves as a platform to document and share my research progress, insights, and beyond. </i>

Feel free to contact me via email at [ychoi6@huskers.unl.edu](mailto:ychoi6@huskers.unl.edu) or explore our lab’s work at [Songlab website](https://cms.unl.edu/engineering/song-lab/).

Thank you for visiting my website!
